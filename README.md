# registered_meteorites
Some testing with QGIS TimeManager using #OpenData of registered meteorite landing places in the world.

First there are some examples of the Meteorite QGIS-Projects.

Secondly, there is an export version to qgis2web on which you can interactively explore the landing sites and information about the meteorites: [Explore known Meteorite Landings: ](https://github.com/DonGoginho/registered_meteorites/blob/master/qgis2map/index.html).
